        "C++"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "JavaScript is the primary programming language for client-side web development. It runs in the browser and allows developers to create dynamic, interactive web pages by manipulating the DOM, handling events, and communicating with servers."

      ],

        "color",
        "background-color",
        "bg-color",
        "background"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The 'background-color' property is the CSS property specifically designed to set the background color of an element. While 'background' is a shorthand property that can also set background color, 'background-color' is the most precise and commonly used property for this purpose."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "Which HTTP protocol is secure?",
      "options": [
        "HTTP",
        "FTP",
        "HTTPS",
        "SMTP"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data transmission between the client and server, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged information."

    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "In Go, how do you declare a variable?",
      "options": [
        "var name string",
        "string name",
        "name := string",
        "declare name as string"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "In Go, variables are declared using the 'var' keyword followed by the variable name and its type. The syntax 'var name string' declares a variable called 'name' of type string. Go also supports short variable declaration using ':=' for type inference."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "What is the default port for HTTP?",
      "options": [
        "443",
        "8080",
        "80",
        "3000"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "Port 80 is the default port for HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol). When you access a website without specifying a port (like http://example.com), the browser automatically uses port 80. Port 443 is used for HTTPS, while 8080 and 3000 are commonly used for development servers."

      "id": 7,

        "Changes the color to transparent"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "'display: none' completely removes the element from the document flow, making it invisible and not taking up any space. This is different from 'visibility: hidden' which hides the element but preserves its space in the layout."
    },
